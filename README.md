# mk3-focus-can
this is a .dbc for use with savvycan to decode the main HS-CAN bus data from the mk3 Focus ST/RS.

some major things have yet to be decoded (namely I want to eventually figure out the message the Body Control Module sends the PCM to trigger A/C)

Software: SavvyCan 

Hardware: Macchina M2 running GVRET

HSCAN baud speed is 500kbps
